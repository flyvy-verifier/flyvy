# Temporal Verifier

[![CI](https://github.com/vmware-research/temporal-verifier/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/vmware-research/temporal-verifier/actions/workflows/build.yml)

## Overview

An experimental framework for temporal verification based on
first-order linear-time temporal logic. Our goal is to express
transition systems in first-order logic and verify temporal
correctness properties, including safety and liveness.

## Try it out

`cargo run -- verify examples/lockserver.fly`

`echo -e "1\nF node n1 n2\n0\n3" | cargo run -- infer examples/lockserver.fly`

### Prerequisites

You'll need Rust (for example, through `rustup`) and recent versions of [Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3), [CVC4](https://cvc4.github.io/), and [cvc5](https://cvc5.github.io/).

### Build & Run

1. `cargo build`
2. `cargo test` to run tests
3. `cargo run -- verify <file.fly>` will run the verifier on an input file

You can run `cargo bench` to run the performance benchmarks.

## Documentation

Run `cargo doc` to generate the low-level API documentation. Currently there
isn't much documentation for the language itself, but you can look at the
examples under `examples/`.
